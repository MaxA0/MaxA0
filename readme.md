## Dijkstra Pathfinding
To enable new parents and children find their way around the school I have created a mapping system. With complex floor layouts and staircases that do not access all floors this was a perfect test for pathfinder algorithms.

## Buffon's needle problem
This is a script I made after my statistics teacher introduced us to the buffon's needle problem The needle problem is able to estimate the value of pi, the more needles you drop / count, the closer you can get to the value of pi.
